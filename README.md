# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the application of software engineering principles methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software system
importance
enabling the creation of softwareand systems that powers various aspects of modern life including communication and entertainment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Advent of structured programming
 sp introduced the concept of dividing a profram into a clearhierachical blocks with asingle entry and exit point.improves readability,reduced errors etc
 introduction of object oriented programming
 oop is based on the concept of objects which are instances of classes that enscapulate both data and behaviour.Allows better organization of code re use through inheritance etc
 Agile methodology
 it emphasized iterative development customer collaboration and flexibility over rigid planning

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-project scope ,objectives and feasibility are determined
Requirements analysis -involves gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand what the software needs to do
Design-software architecture is defined based on requirements
implementation-Actual code is written based on the  design concept
Testing-ensures software functions correctly and meet the requirements
deployment-it is deployed  to production environment whereit becomes available for use by end user
maintainance-providing ongoing support updates and enhancements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology
follows a linear and sequential approach used in large ,complex projects wirh fixed requirements
Agile methodology
follows iterative and incremental  approach where project is divided i to small manageable units used in projects wirh clear well documented process

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
Design and  development-rensponsible for writing and developing codes
maintainance-maintain and improve existing codebases
quality assurance
Testing-design and execute test to get code defects
Quality standard -ensures the final product meets the quality standards set by organization
project manager
planning-Develop detailed plans including milestone and resource allocation
monitoring and reporting - Track the progress of the project to ensure deadline are met


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
intergrated development environment
it intergrates multiple tools  required for coding debugging testing and deploying applications in one platform
Example
visual studio code 
pycharm
version control system
it tracks every modification made to  the codebase allowing  multiple developers to collaborate  on aproject
Examples
Git
subversion
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges
challenge:keeping up with rapidly changing technology
strategy:continuos learning and community involvement
challenge:managing complexity in large projects
strategy:modular design and documentation
Challenge:Dealing with unclear  or changing requirements
strategy;Agile methodology and communication
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-involves testing individual components or unit software application in isolation
Importance:Early bug detection and code quality
integration testing-Focuses on testing the interaction between different modules or components of a software application.
importance:interface testing and system stability
system testing-level of testing where the complete and fully intergrated software product is tested as whole
Importance;End to End validation
Acceptance testing-it is conducted to determine whether the system is ready for release
Importance:customer satisfaction 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering-is the process of crafting and refining prompts designed to elicit desired rensponses
imoortance
maximize model performance and controlling output quality
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
improved prompt:it is clear and specific and concise
